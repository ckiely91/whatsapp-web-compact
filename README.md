# Whatsapp Web Compact

## Overview

Very very simple CSS update to https://web.whatsapp.com to hide the side menu below 600px width. This is handy for having a Whatsapp Web browser window snapped to, for example, 20% of your screen width.

Note: You'll need to resize the window to above 600px to access the side menu again.
